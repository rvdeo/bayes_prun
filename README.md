# Bayesian Neural Network Pruning

## Overview
This repository provides an implementation of Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) with pruning functionality, focusing on improving the efficiency and interpretability of neural networks while maintaining high predictive performance. The primary goals of this project are to:

- Leverage Bayesian inference for robust uncertainty quantification in model predictions.
- Employ signal-to-noise ratio-based methods for structured and unstructured pruning.
- Enhance computational efficiency through parallelized implementations.

This repository includes key scripts and notebooks for working with BNNs, applying MCMC sampling, and testing pruning techniques.
